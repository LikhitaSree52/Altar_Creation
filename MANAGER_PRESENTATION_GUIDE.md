# Project Brief

A full-stack web app for Altar Designing, built using React (frontend) and Node.js/Express with MongoDB (backend). Users can register/login, design custom altars with drag-and-drop, save/load their designs to the cloud, and download images. All features are modular, with clean UI/UX, and the codebase is fully documented and maintainable.

# Manager Presentation Guide - Altar Designing

> **Note:** The codebase is now clean and only contains essential files for frontend and backend. All unnecessary files and unused models have been removed for maintainability and clarity.

## 🎯 Quick Project Summary (30 seconds)

**What we built**: A web application that lets users create digital altar designs for memorial purposes.

**Key Value**: Users can upload photos of loved ones, add decorative items, and create beautiful memorial altars that they can download and share.

**Technology**: React-based web app with drag-and-drop functionality.

## 🔄 Code Flow & Navigation (Technical Deep Dive)

### Application Entry Point
1. **`Altar_Creation/frontend/public/index.html`** → Main HTML file
2. **`Altar_Creation/frontend/src/index.js`** → React entry point
3. **`Altar_Creation/frontend/src/App.js`** → Main App component with routing

### User Journey Flow

#### 1. Initial Load
```
index.html → index.js → App.js → AuthContext.js → WelcomePage.jsx
```
- **AuthContext.js**: Checks if user is logged in
- **WelcomePage.jsx**: Landing page with "Start Building" button

#### 2. Authentication Flow
```
WelcomePage.jsx → Login.jsx/Register.jsx → AuthContext.js → designService.js → backend/auth.js
```
- **Login.jsx/Register.jsx**: User authentication forms
- **AuthContext.js**: Manages user session state
- **designService.js**: Makes API calls to backend
- **backend/auth.js**: Handles authentication on server

#### 3. Main Application Flow
```
WelcomePage.jsx → AltarBuilder.jsx → ItemPalette.jsx → DesignManager.jsx
```

**AltarBuilder.jsx** (Main Orchestrator):
- Receives props from App.js
- Manages all altar state (items, photos, colors)
- Handles drag/drop, resize, download operations
- Renders ItemPalette and main canvas

**ItemPalette.jsx** (Sidebar):
- Receives callbacks from AltarBuilder
- Handles user interactions (color changes, uploads)
- Sends data back to AltarBuilder via props

**DesignManager.jsx** (Modal):
- Receives design data from AltarBuilder
- Makes API calls via designService.js
- Updates AltarBuilder state when designs are loaded

#### 4. Backend API Flow
```
designService.js → backend/index.js → backend/routes/designs.js → backend/models/Design.js → MongoDB
```

**designService.js** (Frontend API Layer):
- Makes HTTP requests to backend
- Handles authentication headers
- Processes responses

**backend/index.js** (Server Entry):
- Sets up Express server
- Connects to MongoDB
- Routes requests to appropriate handlers

**backend/routes/designs.js** (API Endpoints):
- `/api/designs` - GET (load designs), POST (save designs)
- `/api/designs/:id` - DELETE (delete designs)

**backend/models/Design.js** (Database Schema):
- Defines design data structure
- Handles MongoDB operations

### Data Flow Architecture

#### State Management
```
AltarBuilder.jsx (Parent State)
├── items[] → Rendered on canvas
├── deceasedPhoto → Displayed with frame
├── wallBgColor → Background styling
├── frameStyle → Photo frame selection
└── altarName → Design name for saving
```

#### Component Communication
```
AltarBuilder.jsx (Parent)
├── Props to ItemPalette.jsx:
│   ├── onWallColorChange()
│   ├── onPhotoUpload()
│   ├── onFrameStyleChange()
│   └── onItemSelect()
├── Props to DesignManager.jsx:
│   ├── designs[]
│   ├── onLoadDesign()
│   └── onDeleteDesign()
└── Event handlers:
    ├── handleDrop() → Adds items to state
    ├── handleResize() → Updates item dimensions
    └── handleDownload() → Converts canvas to image
```

#### API Integration
```
User Action → Component → designService.js → Backend API → Database
Example: Save Design
AltarBuilder.jsx → designService.saveDesign() → POST /api/designs → MongoDB
```

### File Dependencies Map
