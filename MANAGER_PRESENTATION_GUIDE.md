# Project Brief

A full-stack web app for 3D Room Designing with an altar builder, built using React (frontend) and Node.js/Express with MongoDB (backend). Users can register/login, design custom altars with drag-and-drop, save/load their designs to the cloud, and download images. All features are modular, with clean UI/UX, and the codebase is fully documented and maintainable.

# Manager Presentation Guide - 3D Room Designing Altar Builder

> **Note:** The codebase is now clean and only contains essential files for frontend and backend. All unnecessary files and unused models have been removed for maintainability and clarity.

## üéØ Quick Project Summary (30 seconds)

**What we built**: A web application that lets users create digital altar designs for memorial purposes.

**Key Value**: Users can upload photos of loved ones, add decorative items, and create beautiful memorial altars that they can download and share.

**Technology**: React-based web app with drag-and-drop functionality.
